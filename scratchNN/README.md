Made in February 2023.

These are the final projects in my attempt to create a neural network from scratch.

The sandwich rater allows you to put in inputs which the neural network will rate. You will be prompted with an ":", and you will put in xxxxxxx where x is 1 or 0, with 1 corresponding to the ingredient being there and 0 corresponding it to not. The ingredients in order are PB, J, Mud, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Nutella. The sandwich rater will then give you a rating of the sandwich.

The sandwich generator uses an adversarial neural network to generate sandwiches.
