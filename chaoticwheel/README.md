Made in Spring 2024.

Run chaoticwheel.py in python with tkinter installed.

This project demonstrates the relationship between the chaotic waterwheel and the Lorentz attractor, which is drawn according to the wheel's state: x is velocity, y is height of COM, color is the horizontal position of COM.

Water is added to the bucket at the top of the wheel, while draining out from all the others. The size of the bucket is how full it is.
